### My entry for "The weekly game jam" #137

So this was an attempt at an entry for *The weekly game jam* #137. I ended up not completing it due to me running out of time that I allocated to the project.

I am writing a summery about my experiences and all that I learned and I will link it here when its complete.


## How can I see what has been made? 
### The easy way
The easy way to run the game would be to use the [gitbook](https://pinkflufflyllama.github.io/Game-Jam-Entry/src/index.html) which will have the latest commits and pushes
